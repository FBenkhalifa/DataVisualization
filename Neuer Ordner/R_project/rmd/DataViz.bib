  abstract = {Under what conditions do humans comply with social norms in life-and-death situations? Eye witnesses confirm that male passengers and crew respected the norm ``women and children first'' after the collision of the Titanic with an iceberg. In a recent publication Frey et al. (K{\"o}lner Z Soz Sozpsychol 63:237\textendash{}254, 2011) argued that the relatively large time span between the collision and the sinking of the ship was the crucial factor in explaining the remarkable degree of norm compliance. However, as is suggested here, risk perception or ``the definition of the situation'' is a relevant factor too. In contrast to Frey et al. eye-witness reports and statistical evidence raise doubts about the claim that there was no neglect or discrimination of third class passengers during the catastrophic events.},

Information on the passengers and their fate can be used to explore relationships between various tests for differences in survival rates between different groups of passengers. Among the concepts the authors examined are tests for differences of proportions using a normal distribution, a chi-square test for independence, a test for the equality of two logits, and a test for the significance of the coefficient of a binary variable in logit model. The authors examined the relationship between Wald and Lagrange Multiplier test statistics and give two related examples.},

  abstract = {This paper explores what determines the survival of people in a life-and-death situation. The sinking of the Titanic allows us to inquire whether pro-social behavior matters in such extreme situations. This event can be considered a quasi-natural experiment. The empirical results suggest that social norms such as `women and children first' persevered during such an event. Women of reproductive age and crew members had a higher probability of survival. Passenger class, fitness, group size, and cultural background also mattered.},

Titanic were related to their sex and their social class: females were more likely to survive than males, and the chances of survival declined with social class as measured by the class in which the passenger travelled.
